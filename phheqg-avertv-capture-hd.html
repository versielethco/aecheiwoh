If meeting locally, I am in the central Ohio area and this can be purchased for . ~negotiable Thanks for looking. From what I can see, I'm not the only affected by this terrible update. I need my capture card because it brings food to my table. Is there any way to make it work again without installing Windows 7 or something? I have an i5 6600k CPU, 8GB RAM, Geforce GT 730, and my capture card is an Avermedia AverTV HD DVR. Thanks in advance. Location is East Valley, Phx for possible local trades. Timestamp ( I have a AVerMedia AVerTV HD DVR Capture Card ( for sale. I installed it in my old system with the intention of digitizing some VHS tapes.and never actually used it. Includes Retail Box, additional mounting bracket, and Composite/AV/SVideo connector cable, shown in picture. Asking  shipped. Possible trades include: Haswell i3 CPU, Nintendo. Hello, I am trying to use an Osprey 100e video capture card (i want to play some PS2 games on native hardware) but no dice using it under Arch Linux. I used to use this card fine under Windows 10 without installing anything under VLC. dmesg tells me the card is not known to the driver: 3.938857 cx23885: cx23885 driver version 0.0.4 loaded 3.938956 cx23885: cx23885 0 : Your board isn't known (yet) to the drive. I'm not much of a speedrunner myself, but I got my capture card from a recommendation that was made on a speedrunning thread from another forum that I found after a lot of Googling. My capture card is an Avermedia AverTV HD DVR, and for my purposes, it has been the very best I've ever had because there is no delay at all when playing. I don't have a TV, so I use the capture card for all my gaming needs, and ever since I discovered the line doubler I'm looking to make some upgrade to my gaming PC. Right now I'm considering a motherboard and CPU upgrade but I'm open to other suggestions. As well as suggestions on which board and CPU to go with, if that's the case. I get decent FPS in most games. One thing that irritates me is that I have to reboot and switch my PCIe to 1x in order to run my capture card and the video cards. It would be nice to have a board that had ample power for everything. Here's my current build: Type Item :----. 
I have an unusual setup, and I'm looking for a thrifty solution to a problem that's arisen after rearranging my setup. And who knows, maybe what I've found can be helpful to some of you? I play a lot of older video game consoles, that display over standard definition outputs, composite, s-video, and some component video. I have my consoles displayed on a shelf, and connect them to panels I've installed on my shelf when I want to play them. The panel connects to a video amp/splitter which sends. This seems to be a running problem but I havent found any solution for it. I just purchased a Live Gamer HD, and if I dont have "Waveout Audio Render" checked under the source properties, the audio will start to drift out and the delay gets bigger and bigger over time. I had this same issue with the AverTV HD DVR as well. Now while the WaveOut does fix it, it creates another issue where if I want to quickly mute the capture audio of that scene, it mutes all sound on my PC entirely except Do any of you guys stream from a Gaming PC to a Stream PC while using the AVerMedia C027 AVerTV HD DVR? It streams up to 1080i, does it really matter that it does not go up to 1080p? The Capturecard goes into my stream pc right? Is there a better internal Capture card out there. So heres what I want to do: Im looking to stream from my PS3/PS4 and split the signal, 1 to my TV, one to this capture device. I already have all the necessary components as I already have an AverTV HD DVR, but im limited to playing my games at 720p on my TV in order to capture, which is why I want to upgrade to the Live Gamer HD (http://www.amazon.com/AVerMedia-Streaming-Definition-Hardware-C985/dp/B007UXJ6LE/ref=sr_1_1?s=pcampie=UTF8ampqid=1459797168ampsr=1-1ampkeywords=live+gamer+h. Hello fellow lets players, recently I have wanted to start to do lets plays of android games and was wanting to use my old capture card to record them. I currently have an Avermedia HD USB DVR ( My question is that if I run a 1080p component cable through this will it be able to record it? Even if its in 720p? If not any other suggestions on how to record my android? Thanks a bunch. P.s. the reason 
A few months ago I asked about some weird scanline-like artifact issues on my Wii, and that I couldn't determine whether it was my Wii or my capture card (don't have a TV, I use an Avermedia Avertv HD DVR to play games instead), but I finally saw an artifact that looked a lot like what people used to describe when their Wii's graphics processors got burned (launch Wiis used to suffer from this, although mine is from January 2007). So yeah, I'm super bummed. What can I do about Hi guys, I wanna build a new gaming pc (with some juicy 32gb m2 ssd and stuff) and to get some additional money flowing, I want to sell my current rig in the process. This is no "GUYS, BUY MY STUFF"-Thread. I rather seek on advice for how much I can sell this thing without scamming people. (Of course, if someone wants to give me way much for it, than it's worth. =3) Case - Bitfenix Colossus Big-Tower GREEN LED - black with Window Mainboard - Gigabyte GA-Z77x-UDH3 GPU - PowerColor. I have a AVerMedia AVerTV HD DVR C027 Capture card and I am looking to trade for any AM3+, CPU and mobo combo (as long as it has 4 ram slots). Image (http://i.imgur.com/pNhsIj1.jpg). No upgrades, besides an AverTv capture card which isn't really an upgrade. People always criticized me for buying it but I have had no problems. This computer was ,300 bought in the summer of 2010. Has my whole gaming setup in there as well as the computer. EDIT: (Specs) CPU - Intel i7 930 Quad Core @ 3.36Ghz GPU - ATI Radeon HD 5870 HD - 1.5 TB Memory - 6 GB OS - Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit Mouse/Keyboard - Alienware. 
Here's what I've got: ASRock Z77 Extreme4 MSI P67A-GD65-B3 Gigabyte Z68MA-D2H-B3 8GB (2x4) G.Skill DDR3 memory F3-10666CL9D-8GBRL Corsair Hydro H50 CPU cooler AverMedia AverTV HD DVR HDMI capture card Looking mainly for PayPal, but I'd trade for an Elgato Game Capture HD. Also wouldn't mind a pair of Corsair SP120 Quiet Edition fans. Pics: http://imgur.com/a/i0OED. So we had a customer need a computer that would have a ton of ram, be able to capture hd and non hd video, be super quiet, and have dual blu ray burners so the customer can create and make copies of blu ray videos for his business. Now we were going to go with the 4.0Ghz chip but couldn't wait since most places were outta stock. So don't tell me I should have wen't with it, i know and i would have if the customer didn't need the machine asap. Also if your wondering why we didn't Hey guys, I did some search and noticing there are a bunch of old threads about this and wanted to post a new one. Many of them being over two years old. I wanted to stream from my PS3. Supposedly it's a bitch to do because of Hdcp? Also, I think I read it will stream just fine as long as your doing 720p? I really don't like the idea of getting an external product because of overheating issues and I rather have it in my computer. I knew at one point the black magic cards were really Hey Twitch Subreddit sorry for the long post. Been trying to figure out what kind of capture card would fit my needs. Right now I stream PC and Xbox 360 and thats all. Since I already have a i7 laptop I was thinking I could use that as a streaming laptop like seen here by JackFrags Video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqqU95c46pA) I only stream at 720p 60fps or lower so could I buy something like AVerCapture HD (LPG lite) (http://www.amazon.com/GL310-AVerCapture-Video-Capture-Streaming/. Sorry for the long post in advance! Hi everyone. I think found one of the best budget internal capture cards that I believe is good and for those who are on budget and want it under 0 Or like me wanted to play on my pc without any delay through the OBS Preview Screen. For the price of .99 USD, it does what I want needed to do. Get rid of the delay. I borrowed my friend's Elgato Game Capture HD before buying this card and I could not deal with the delays that I had to setup and forget. I have 20 gig xbox 360 console with HDMI port. It was never rrod and the case was never opened. It is still functioning well. I have all the cables but i do not have the controllers. I am primarily looking for BF3 PS3 + DLC + other PS3 games that interests me. I also take offers. Edit: I am also interested in the AverTV HD ( screen capture or other HD capturing devices. I recently purchased an avertv hd dvr pcie capture card for my computer for the purpose of streaming older generation games like n64, snes, GameCube, ps1/2 and was wondering if anyone has any experience with scaling the quality up. I can capture video from composite cables and the default software will display it but everything is pretty bad quality since no upscaling is being done by the card itself. is there any software solution that could possibly improve the image quality during capture?. 
Since I started my channel years and years ago, I've wanted to put up videos of Halo. However, it wasn't until a few months ago I came into the possession of an internal capture card - and even then, the video and audio were always out of sync - whether I used the software (Aver MediaCentre 3D) or VirtualDub or whatever. The card is an AverTV CaptureHD. Well, I've finally found a solution that works properly, and I'm hoping this will be useful for those with a similar predicament - rather. Siberia 200 Headset Timestamp ( Siberia V3 Prism Timestamp ( Avermedia Capture Card Timestamp ( Got some items that I dont need and could use another home. Steelseries Siberia 200 Successor to the Siberia V2, the 200 is basically the same exact headset but with some updated cables so in theory it wont break easily. Uses the standard 3.5mm Headphone and Mic jacks. I only used this once. </p>
