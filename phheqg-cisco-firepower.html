                            <p>Многофункциональное устройство обеспечения безопасности Cisco серии 5500-X с сервисами FirePOWER - это межсетевой экран, обеспечивающий интегрированную защиту от угроз. Three months ago I wrote a Cisco Firepower rant (https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/9363af/cisco_firepower_rant/). It received more attention than I imagined, not only from the /r/networking community but appearently also from the vendor side. I had a nice chat with a TAC engineer, got a PM from the supposedly new ngfw product owner, who decided not to return my PM after I told him I would be willing to write up some feedback, but not through a cisco customer program as he suggested Новейший межсетевой экран нового поколения (NGFW) от Cisco обеспечит устойчивость бизнеса благодаря непревзойденной защите от угроз и стабильной. It's been a while i started to think about to share my 2 years experience with technology but i was not quite convinced or in other words - i felt so disappointed even start to think about doing so because of all the issue with the technology itself. So you can ask - why now?Well, couple of months ago i found "rant" article with a follow up  (available here: https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/9363af/cisco\_firepower\_rant/ (https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/9363af/cis. Cisco ASA 5500-X Series with FirePOWER Services is a firewall appliance that delivers integrated threat defense across the entire attack continuum. 
We're mainly a Fortigate shop for NGFW functionality, though we have ASAs out for basic firewalling capabilities. How are Firepowers features compared to other vendors? Things like: Web filtering Category Individual SSL inspection Determining source user of traffic and allowing its use in rules, e.g. AD integration executable/filetype blocking In-line AV scanning. Cisco FirePOWER - сенсоры нового поколения (NGFW + NGIPS + AMP). FirePOWER позволяет просканировать активы сети встроенной функцией FireSIGHT и построить карту. I started doing Cisco Firepower back in 2015 and after all those years I need to blow off some steam. IMO it was a clunky solution when there was only the ASA + Firepower Services option, an attempt to go to market as quick as possible that felt weird since there was still ASA configuration via CLI/ASDM and Firepower configuration via FMC (or for the very brave ones out there Firepower via ASDM). I wasn't a big fan of the solution and was quite excited when Cisco announced Firepower Threat. Centralize, integrate, and simplify management. This is your administrative nerve center for managing critical Cisco network security solutions. 
Hey guys! I am working on a project with one of my clients, to upgrade their firewalls. We are currently looking at the below models for Cisco: FPR2130-NGFW-K9 List Price ,995 (4.75 Gbps) FPR2140-NGFW-K9 List Price ,995 (8.5 Gbps) amp#x200B; We'd like to explore some cheaper options - Palo Alto, Fortinet, Juniper. Anybody, with experience, have any suggestions as to some less expensive options? We are going to start with throughput, then examine other feature sets from there. Ensure business resiliency through superior threat defense and sustained network performance with the newest next-generation firewall (NGFW) from Cisco. So.we've hit this bug, and hit it hard! https://quickview.cloudapps.cisco.com/quickview/bug/CSCvo12057 (https://quickview.cloudapps.cisco.com/quickview/bug/CSCvo12057) Has anyone else hit this, and if so, what was your fix/workaround other than /ragequit and smash the FTDs into pieces. For instant access to the complete Todd Lammle FirePOWER Online Video Training Series: http://www.lammle.com/firepower. This isn't to ask for help. This is something I discovered. I've recently become the go-to FirePOWER guy at my MSP job since I'm the only one that has had experience with it and has read all the stories about FirePOWER and how to fix them. I don't think FirePOWER is complete trash, but its pretty close. It's what you get when you try to layer several technologies on top of each other instead of creating a distinct and discrete service. Anyways, I have recently had a client Block more threats. Get better security at faster speeds in a 1-rack-unit next-generation firewall (NGFW).  This data sheet describes the benefits, specifications, and ordering information for the Cisco ASA with FirePOWER Services. 
Hello everyone, I have a quick question. I have a report that shows users looking at pornography. How do I identify that user on FMC? UPDATE I figured it out and we found the sources. Few females and males. Not sure about the repercussions. Background. Sourcefire was founded in 2001 by Martin Roesch, the creator of Snort. The company created a commercial version of the Snort software, the Sourcefire 3D System, which evolved into the company's Firepower line of network security products. I am getting conflicting information on how Cisco Firepower responds to a botnet attack. Does it use a botnet traffic filter or a network-based access control rule? I'm having trouble finding documentation that resolves this question. Does anyone know? Thank. Some basic questions. How is Firepower different from ASA? can Firepower replace ASA? If a company has money for only one of these two, which one would 125870. I need to learn Firepower Management, where can I get the VMware ovf so I can train? Any cheatcodes or trials.

From what I've read this means the Firepower module is saying it's seen enough of this particular traffic flow to determine that it doesn't need to inspect it any longer, and please don't send me any more of it. The message continues to appear for the same traffic flow and is repeated quite often, sometimes a few times a second, so I was wondering if the ASA is ignoring it or if that's normal. I did a fair bit of searching but didn't come up with anything definitive.

Firepower NGFWv is the virtualized version of Cisco's next generation firewall product. Hi all, I've got a scenario where I am deploying 2110 firepower firewalls running FTD, controlled via FMC. We have a ruleset that allows FTP control traffic from an internal IP to an external FTP server and this works fine, however the return traffic seems to be dropped. Mu understanding that the FTP data return traffic should undergo inspection and be matched back to the command stream that initiated it. amp#x200B; To me this indicates that we've got an issue with the traffic inspection. Solved: hi there, Question: are there any functional differences between an ASA with FirePOWER functionality enabled and the "pure" FirePOWER IPS Appliances (e. g. 7000 and 8000 Series IPS Modules)? Thanks a lot! Kind regards, David. My colleague has been working on a pipeline for our Elasticsearch cluster in order to automate our IPS alert responses. This is a pipeline that we just started using but wanted to see if anyone else using ELK as a SIEM, and had any suggestions when writing for IPS alerts within the Firepower. amp#x200B; Here's the repo on Github: IPS Pipeline (https://github.com/alta01/Cisco_Firepower_IPS_Pipeline) amp#x200B; Hope this helps someone get started, just be aware that some IP areas I'v been trying to figure out if this is possible somehow. - spoiler.

Hi All, Has anyone here managed to block Amazon Prime video while allowing the Amazon website using Cisco Firepower? Blocking the application ''Amazon Instant video'' does nothing and all the URL's generated from Prime video are r/ https://www.amazon.com/ (https://www.amazon.com/) based. It's not possible to block the sub-domain while allowing the parent domain so I am not sure how I am going to accomplish the block without blocking Amazon entirely. amp#x200B; Thanks in advance. amp#x20. 
Hi. I configured Remote Access VPN on my Cisco FTD 6.2.2. At the first I created a VPN profile with standalone VPN Profile Editor on my PC and saved it. Then On the FTD I set up Split tunnel config as this: Group Policy gt General tab gt DNS/Wins ==========gt Primary DNS =my internal DNS server Group Policy gt General tab gt DNS/Wins ==========gt Secondary DNS =a public DNS Server Group Policy gt General tab gt Default Domain ===========gt xinmix.test Group Policy Reddit, I need your help. I’m trying to set up website to be externally accessible, but the external DNS entry points to the same IP Address as our VPN website. My co-worker says that it has to have a different IP address. My first reaction was no – the URL requested should be in the packet, so we should be able to tell our firewall where to direct it. But my education on networking and routing is almost 20 years old – so while I know the basics, the specifics have changed a lot. So I’m We recently upgraded to Cisco's FTD 6.3 and the syslog format changed on us. QRadar can no longer recognize or parse our access control events.
